# Afforestation

**Plant new forests and restore old forests.** As trees grow, they draw carbon out of the air, which reduces the concentration of carbon dioxide. However, without care, large-scale afforestation can compromise biodiversity and historical land rights.

### Examples

- Government policies, incentives, and funding to identify available land, plant trees, and manage forests.
- Business, land owner, and public support for large scale tree planting.

|   | **status quo** | low growth | medium growth | high growth |

| Percent of maximum potential | **0% to +15%** | +15% to +40% | +40% to +70% | +70% to +100% |

### Key Dynamics

- Growing more trees boosts global removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  Photosynthesis pulls carbon into biomass and soils. Watch the temperature decrease modestly as a result.
- Explore the graph "Land for Carbon Dioxide Removal".  If we were to reforest 1500 million hectares, an astronomical amount given that the land mass of India is 300 million hectares, we would still not see much change in temperature.

### Big Message

- This could be part of the silver buckshot, but land availability and other effects should be considered.

### Model Structure Notes

The input changes total or gross carbon removal from trees and plants through photosynthesis. The carbon sequestration of forests changes over time as the forest matures. Notice that net carbon removals are different than total removals due to carbon loss in older or unhealthy forests.
