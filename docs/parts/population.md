# Population Growth

**Assume higher or lower population growth.** Population is a key driver of increased greenhouse gases; however, this is also tied heavily to consumption habits. Women's education and access to family planning could accelerate shifts to smaller families worldwide.

### Examples

- Different assumptions for future fertility rates and demographics.
- Greater empowerment of women and girls, resulting in lower fertility rates.
- Increased education on and access to reproductive health services.

### Slider Settings

This input is indexed, where 1 is the UN's low growth scenario, 2 is medium, and 3 is high. The slider is limited to a range of 1.6-2.4 to reflect the 95% probability range of population deviating from the medium growth path.

|   | low growth | **status quo** | high growth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario | 1.6 to 2 | **2 to 2.3** | 2.3 to 2.4 |
| Population by 2100 | 9.6 billion | **11.1 billion** | 13.3 billion |

### Key Dynamics

- Watch all the sources of energy change their future as you change population growth.

### Big Message

- Contrary to some people's beliefs, population growth is not a silver bullet for addressing climate change.
- Decisions around population and family choice are very personal decisions and efforts to shift these decisions have ethical implications in many cultures.

### Model Structure Notes

Population gets multiplied with economic growth (GDP per capita) to equal total global GDP, or Gross World Product.
