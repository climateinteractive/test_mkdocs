# Nuclear

**Encourage or discourage building nuclear power plants.** Nuclear power production does not release carbon dioxide, but it produces harmful nuclear waste.

### Examples

Discouraging

- Public information campaigns to raise public concerns about the risks of nuclear power.
- Policies to retire existing nuclear power plants.

Encouraging

- Government policies aimed at handling nuclear waste and reducing costs of nuclear power.
- Corporate efforts to promote public acceptance of nuclear power plants.

|   | highly taxed | taxed | status quo | subsidized | highly subsidized |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Change in price per kilowatt hour (kWh) | +$0.05 to +$0.10 | +$0.01 to +$0.05 | **+$0.01 to -$0.01** | -$0.01 to -$0.05 | -$0.05 to -$0.10 |
| Cost increase or decrease | +30% to +60% | +10% to +30% | **+10% to -10%** | -10% to -30% | -30% to -60% |


### Key Dynamics

- As you subsidize nuclear, watch the light blue line move up and the brown line of coal and the dark blue line of gas move down in the "Sources of Primary Energy" graph. Nuclear displaces some fossil fuel sources, which keeps carbon in the ground and helps to reduce temperature modestly.
- Nuclear competes with all energy sources available, so notice also what happens to renewable energy—it goes down too.


### Big Message

- Nuclear is not a huge driver of future temperature and hinders the growth of renewables and new technology
- It could be part of a suite of climate action if one is willing to accept the environmental costs – e.g., handling waste materials and the risk of radiation damage near the plants.

### Model Structure Notes

This sector tracks several stages of nuclear power plants, or "energy supply capacity":  capacity under development, under construction, and actually producing energy, including delays between each stage.
