# Deforestation

**Decrease or increase the loss of forests for agricultural and wood product uses.** Deforestation often entails burning and removing forests to clear land for crops like soybeans, corn, or palm oil. Forest protection efforts increase biodiversity and can support community resilience.

### Examples

- Government policy to preserve forested land and place restrictions on industries such as soybean and/or palm oil.
- Increased support for indigenous land rights.
- Public support and campaigns to support land preservation.

### Key Dynamics

- Highly reducing deforestation emissions reduces temperature less than most people would estimate.  View the "Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas â€“ Stacked" graph to see the role of land use (deforestation) CO2 relative to all the other sources of emissions.

### Big Message

- Efforts to reduce deforestation is relatively low leverage for the climate, but it is one part of multi-pronged effort.
- Protecting forests are helpful for many other reasons other than the environment, including protecting biodiversity and native people's lands.

Model Structure Notes
While emissions from fossil fuels are expected to grow significantly in the business as usual scenario, emissions from deforestation are expected to decrease as there are fewer and fewer forests that could be burned and converted to agriculture. This means that the portion of carbon dioxide from deforestation becomes much smaller in the coming decades.
