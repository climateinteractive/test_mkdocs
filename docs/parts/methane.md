# Methane & Other Gases

**Decrease or increase greenhouse gas emissions from methane, nitrous oxide, and the f-gases.** Methane is released from sources like cows, agriculture, natural gas drilling, and waste. Nitrous oxide comes from fertilizers. The f-gases, includes HFCs, PFCs, and others that are used in industry and consumer goods like air conditioners.

### Examples

- Decreased meat consumption.
- Modified agricultural practices such as increasing digestion of manure and decreasing fertilizer use.
- Decreased leakage from oil and gas industries.
- Increased capturing of gases emitted from landfills.
- Research and development on substitutions for f-gases (e.g. SF6 and HFC) in industrial processes.

### Key Dynamics

- Watch temperature fall as emissions of methane, N2O, and F-gases fall.  They comprise 30% of current greenhouse gas emissions and are very important in addressing climate change.

### Big Message

- Reducing methane, nitrous oxide, and the f-gases is high leverage, although many approaches to reducing these emissions need more research and support to scale up.

### Model Structure Notes

The model limits how much these emissions can be reduced, since some are considered unavoidable, particularly those from agriculture, landfills, and wastewater.

### FAQs on Model Structure and Behavior

How much of the lever is due to cattle? How much would eating more plant-based diets help?

### Co-Benefits

- Vegetarian diets and farming practices that rely less on chemicals can improve population health.
