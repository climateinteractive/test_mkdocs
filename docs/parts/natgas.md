# Natural Gas

**Discourage or encourage drilling and burning natural gas for energy.** Natural Gas is a fossil fuel that is used for electricity, heating, and industry. When burned, it releases carbon dioxide (although less than coal and oil) and, if leaked into the air, it contains high amounts of methane. Natural gas drilling uses large amounts of water and can cause contamination.

### Examples

- Governments implementing laws against fracking and taxes on natural gas.
- Financial services industry (e.g., banks) or global development institutions (e.g., World Bank) limiting access to capital.

| Change in price per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) | +$4.00 to +$6.00 | +$2.00 to +$4.00 | +$0.60 to +$2.00 | **+$0.60 to -$0.60** | -$0.60 to -$2.00 |
| Cost increase or decrease | +60% to +100% | +30% to +60% | +10% to +30% | **+10% to -10%** | -10% to -30% |

### Key Dynamics

If gas (blue line) is subsidized, coal goes down (brown line) in the Sources of Primary Energy graph. The transition from a fuel of a higher carbon density to a lower carbon density avoids some emissions, but there is also slightly less renewable and nuclear energy use as well. Natural gas still releases carbon emissions and so if natural gas infrastructure is built it will lock-in emissions until that infrastructure is shut down.

### Big Message

More natural gas is not an effective long-term strategy for the climate â€“ it is not an effective bridge to a low carbon world.

### Model Structure Notes

The cost of natural gas affects three significant decisions regarding energy infrastructure:

1. investment in new capacity (whether or not to build new processing and power plants);
2. use of capacity (whether to run existing plants);
3. retirement of capacity (whether to keep plants longer or shorter than the average of ~30 years).
