# Technological Carbon Dioxide Removal

**Pull carbon dioxide out of the air with new technologies that enhance natural removals or manually sequester and store carbon.** Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies include: direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), biochar, and others. These are not yet used at large scales, and most face significant barriers to deployment.

### Examples

- Advancements in various CDR technologies through research and development and government policies.
- Support from businesses, land owners, and general public to implement such technologies.

### Key Dynamics

- Look at the related graph, "Land for Carbon Dioxide Removal" and note the amount of land area the approaches might require.

### Big Message

- While Technological Carbon Removal has potential, it does not currently exist at scale.

### Model Structure Notes

The five methods of CO2 removal included are modeled independently. They each vary in their maximum sequestration potential, the year they might start to scale up, how long it takes them to be phased in, and the carbon leakage rate over time (stored carbon is not always permanent).
